### Day 1 of 60 Machine Learning Challenge ðŸ’«
- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is basically predicting test data points labels based on trained data. In training, we actually store the x and y values. In predicting part, we calculate the distance between x value of test point with other x values of train data. After that, we give the closest x points label as a test points label. In k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm we do the same steps and take the majority vote of k closest data points. As a result, we predict test points label as the majority of labels.
- I benefited from A Course in Machine Learning by Hal DaumÃ© III Chapter 3 | GEOMETRY AND NEAREST NEIGHBORS.
- You can find notes that I took for Nearest Neighbor and k-Nearest Neighbor from [here](https://medium.com/@gokcenazakyol/what-is-nearest-neighbor-classifier-machine-learning-1-26b8ec1b9f7b).
- Here you can see the k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm from scratch.
